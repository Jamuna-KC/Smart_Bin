This project leverages IoT technology to provide real-time monitoring of various smart bins that are interconnected through a shared database. 
It allows us to observe the fill levels of these smart bins and analyze when they become full. 
This capability enables timely waste collection and disposal as soon as a bin reaches its capacity.
